# Android Kotlin Location Info

## Project Description

Android Kotlin Location Info is an Android application that provides users with detailed information about their current geographic location. The app leverages device sensors and APIs to display real-time location data, such as latitude, longitude, address, and more.

## Features

- Display current latitude and longitude
- Show address information using reverse geocoding
- Real-time location updates
- Simple and user-friendly interface
- (Optional) Save and view location history

## Project Overview for New Contributors

This section provides a high-level overview of the codebase to help new contributors quickly understand the project structure and how its components interact.

### Major Folders and Files

- **`app/`**: Main Android application source code.
  - **`src/main/java/`**: Contains all Kotlin source files.
    - **`com.example.locationinfo/`**: Main package for the app's logic, including activities, view models, and utility classes.
      - `MainActivity.kt`: Entry point of the app, handles UI and location updates.
      - `LocationViewModel.kt`: Manages location data and business logic.
      - `LocationUtils.kt`: Utility functions for location and geocoding.
  - **`src/main/res/`**: Resources such as layouts, strings, and images.
    - `layout/activity_main.xml`: Main UI layout.
    - `values/strings.xml`: App text resources.
- **`build.gradle`**: Project and app-level build configuration.
- **`README.md`**: Project documentation (this file).

### Architecture

The app follows a simple MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture:
- **View (Activity/Fragment)**: Handles UI and user interactions.
- **ViewModel**: Contains logic for fetching and processing location data.
- **Model/Utils**: Provides data structures and helper functions.

There is no separate backend or database by default, but you can extend the app to include local storage or remote APIs.

### Component Interaction

- The UI (MainActivity) observes the ViewModel for location updates.
- The ViewModel uses utility classes to fetch and process location data.
- Data flows from device sensors → ViewModel → UI.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project for local development:

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/android_kotlin_location_info.git
   cd android_kotlin_location_info-1
   ```

2. **Open in Android Studio**
   - Launch Android Studio.
   - Select "Open an existing project" and choose this folder.

3. **Install Dependencies**
   - Android Studio will automatically sync and install required dependencies via Gradle.

4. **Run the App**
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator.
   - Click the "Run" button in Android Studio.

5. **(Optional) Configure API Keys**
   - If using APIs (e.g., Google Maps), add your API keys to the appropriate configuration files.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add location history feature
- [ ] Integrate map view
- [ ] Improve UI/UX
- [ ] Add unit and UI tests
- [ ] Support for more location providers
